:::cheapest Hotel Room Finding System:::

How to Run:::

- clone the repository "Ruby"
- Navigate to "hotelroom_booking" directory
- Check the ruby bin directory by executing "which ruby" and update the path
  in each ruby file in that directory
- make sure all the files has execute permission - to do that execute "chmod
  +x *"
- Finally run the ./find_cheapest_hotel.rb


Requirements Pending:::
- Still the comparison for cheapest hotel has to be made
- Need to return rating from the specific hotel objects to choose the hotel when there is a tie in the rate


Yet to Implement:::

- Getting the inputs from user
- Parsing the Input
- Input Validation
- Reading the constant values(rates,days,etc..) from property or yaml file
- correction in any object oriented design
- More debuggers as needed
